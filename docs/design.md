# Wallet Transfer Service — design note

Written before the implementation, per the documentation-first workflow in
[ASSIGNMENT.md](../ASSIGNMENT.md). It records the contract, the failure modes,
and the decisions that are easy to get wrong and expensive to change later.

## Problem

Move money between two wallets such that the transfer is atomic, recorded as a
balanced double-entry pair, safe under concurrent debits of the same wallet, and
**exactly-once at the API level** when the caller supplies an `idempotencyKey`.

The hard part is not the arithmetic. It is that the caller may send the same
request twice, the network may lose a response after the money has already
moved, and two requests may race for the same balance. Each of those has to
produce one and only one transfer.

## Scope

In scope: `POST /transfers`, wallet balances, the double-entry ledger, the
transfer state machine, idempotent replay.

Explicitly **out of scope**, as optional enhancements in the brief:

| Not building | Why it matters here |
|---|---|
| Wallet balance API (`GET /wallets/{id}`) | No read path by wallet, so no index for one |
| Transfer history API | Same; see [Indexes](#indexes) |
| Authentication / multi-tenancy | Determines the idempotency key namespace; see below |
| Reversals, refunds, multi-currency, partial transfers | Each changes the ledger model |
| Metrics, tracing | Logging only; see [Observability](#observability) |

Wallets are assumed to already exist. Nothing in scope creates one, so wallets
are seeded directly (see [Testing](#testing)).

## API contract

### Request

```http
POST /transfers
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId": "wallet_2",
  "amount": 100
}
```

`amount` is an integer in **minor units** (cents), never a decimal or float.
It decodes into an `int64`, so `100.5` is rejected at decode rather than
silently truncated. Unknown fields are rejected, so a misspelled field name
fails loudly instead of being ignored.

Validation, all producing `400`:

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `idempotencyKey` | required, non-empty, at most 255 characters |
| `fromWalletId` | required, non-empty |
| `toWalletId` | required, non-empty, different from `fromWalletId` |
| `amount` | required, integer, greater than zero |

### Response

One body shape for every outcome, success or failure, so a client parses one
thing:

```json
{
  "id": "9f8c1a4e-0f1e-4c2b-9a77-6b2d1f0c5a31",
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId": "wallet_2",
  "amount": 100,
  "state": "PROCESSED",
  "failureReason": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-09-12T10:23:03Z"
}
```

`state` is the authoritative answer. A client never has to read the status code
to learn what happened to its money — that matters because the status code is
the part most likely to be mangled by a proxy.

Errors that never produced a transfer return:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "WALLET_NOT_FOUND", "message": "wallet wallet_9 does not exist" } }
```

### Status codes

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `201 Created` | A new transfer was created and processed |
| `200 OK` | Replay of a key whose transfer already processed — identical body |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed JSON, unknown field, or failed validation |
| `404 Not Found` | `fromWalletId` or `toWalletId` does not exist |
| `409 Conflict` | Key already used with **different** parameters |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Insufficient funds — on the first call and on every replay |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Lock timeout; the request is safe to retry unchanged |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Anything unanticipated |

Replays also carry `Idempotent-Replay: true`.

The asymmetry is deliberate: a replayed success returns `200` rather than `201`
because nothing was created on that call, while a replayed failure returns `422`
both times because the failure *is* the answer and downgrading it to `200` would
invite a client to treat a failed transfer as a successful one. The body is
byte-identical across calls either way; only the status distinguishes "created
now" from "already existed". The alternative — replaying the original status
verbatim, so the caller cannot tell a replay from a first call — is defensible
too, but makes `201 Created` a lie on a call that created nothing.

## Idempotency

`transfers.idempotency_key` carries a `UNIQUE` constraint. The key is claimed
with a single statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO transfers (id, idempotency_key, request_hash, from_wallet_id,
                       to_wallet_id, amount, state)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, 'PENDING')
ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING
RETURNING id;
```

A returned row means this request owns the key. **No row means someone else owns
it**, so the existing transfer is read and returned. The database arbitrates;
there is no check-then-insert window for two requests to slip through.

This is also why the claim is safe against a *concurrent* duplicate rather than
merely a sequential one: when another transaction holds an uncommitted row with
the same key, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` blocks until that transaction commits or
rolls back. On commit, the second request sees a settled transfer; on rollback,
it claims the key itself. It can never observe `PENDING`.

**`request_hash`** is `SHA-256` over the *parsed* fields, canonicalised as
`fromWalletId \n toWalletId \n amount`, hex-encoded. Hashing parsed fields
rather than the raw body means whitespace, key order, or an added unknown field
cannot cause a false `409`. The idempotency key itself is excluded — it is the
lookup key, not part of what is being fingerprinted. A replay whose hash differs
from the stored one returns `409`: the alternative, returning a transfer the
caller did not ask for, is worse than an error.

**Namespace: global.** There is no authentication in scope, so a key is unique
across the whole service. The consequence is real and worth stating: two
independent callers who both choose `"abc123"` collide, and the second receives
either the first's transfer or a `409`. In a multi-tenant deployment the
constraint becomes `UNIQUE (client_id, idempotency_key)` and the key is scoped
to the authenticated caller. That is a one-column change, deliberately deferred
rather than half-built.

**Transfer ids** are UUIDv4 generated in Go, not by the database. The id is then
known before the statement runs, so it can be logged with the claim attempt
regardless of outcome, and the service does not depend on the `pgcrypto`
extension or a minimum PostgreSQL version for `gen_random_uuid()`. On a
conflicting claim the generated id is simply discarded.

## Transaction and concurrency

One transaction covers the whole transfer. `READ COMMITTED`, PostgreSQL's
default, is sufficient because correctness comes from row locks rather than from
isolation: every balance read happens under `FOR UPDATE`, so there is no
read-then-write window to protect. `SERIALIZABLE` would add serialization
failures that must be retried in a loop, which is strictly more machinery for a
guarantee the locks already provide.

1. **Claim the idempotency key.** No row back → read the existing transfer and
   return it, taking no wallet locks. Replays are cheap.
2. **Lock both wallets**, as two separate statements issued in ascending wallet
   id order:
   ```sql
   SELECT balance FROM wallets WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE;
   ```
   Separate statements rather than one `WHERE id IN (...) ORDER BY id`: a single
   statement almost certainly locks in sorted order, but only because the plan
   happens to sort before locking, which is a property of the planner rather
   than of the query. Two statements make the ordering a property of the code,
   and consistent ordering is what stops two opposing transfers between the same
   pair from deadlocking.

   Both wallets are guaranteed to exist by this point — the claim in step 1
   carries foreign keys, so an unknown wallet has already aborted the
   transaction, and neither row can vanish underneath us while the transfer
   references it. A missing row here would be a bug, not a 404.
3. **Check sufficiency.** Short → mark `FAILED` with a reason, **commit**, return
   `422`.
4. **Move the money**, relative rather than absolute:
   ```sql
   UPDATE wallets SET balance = balance - $1, updated_at = now() WHERE id = $2;
   ```
5. **Insert both ledger entries**, one `DEBIT` and one `CREDIT`.
6. **Mark `PROCESSED`** with a guarded transition, and commit.

Correctness comes from holding the row lock across the read and the write. The
relative `UPDATE` is defensive style on top of that, not the thing that makes it
safe — under `FOR UPDATE` an absolute write would be equally correct.

**A failed transfer is committed, not rolled back.** This is the decision most
worth defending. Rolling back would release the idempotency key, so a retry
would re-attempt the debit and could succeed once the balance changed — the same
key producing two different answers, which is precisely what idempotency is
supposed to forbid. Committing the `FAILED` row means the key is permanently
bound to that answer. A caller who tops the wallet up and genuinely wants to
retry must use a **new** idempotency key; that is a correct requirement, not a
limitation.

`PENDING` therefore never escapes the transaction. It is not decorative: it is
the state in which the key is claimed but the money has not moved, and it is the
row that would survive if this ever became a two-phase or asynchronous transfer.

The transition out of it is guarded in SQL as well as in the domain —
`WHERE id = $1 AND state = 'PENDING'`, with a zero row count treated as an
error. **In the flow above that guard never fires.** The service settles each
transfer exactly once, inside the transaction that created the row, and no other
transaction can see that row before it commits, let alone change its state. So
the guard is defence in depth rather than a live check.

It is kept because it costs one clause and it is the difference between a double
settlement being impossible and being merely unlikely. Nothing in the current
flow calls a transition twice; a retry loop, a second code path, or a background
worker added later might, and the guard means such a change cannot silently
settle a transfer twice or overwrite a recorded failure. The repository test
settles a transfer twice on purpose to confirm the second attempt is refused.

One imprecision to be aware of: a zero row count is reported as an invalid state
transition, which also covers a transfer id that does not exist at all. Both are
programming errors rather than runtime conditions, so they are not told apart —
distinguishing them would cost an extra query for a case that cannot occur.

### Wallet existence

The claim in step 1 carries foreign keys to `wallets`, so an unknown wallet
raises `23503` and aborts the transaction. The handler maps that to `404`,
reading `transfers_from_wallet_fk` or `transfers_to_wallet_fk` from the error to
name the offending wallet — which is why those constraints are named explicitly
in the migration rather than left to PostgreSQL's defaults.

Because the transaction aborts, **the key is not claimed**. A later valid request
reusing that key succeeds rather than returning `409`. That is correct: the first
attempt created nothing, so there is no prior result to be idempotent about.
Validation failures behave the same way — they are rejected before any database
work.

**Only one wallet is named when both are missing.** PostgreSQL validates the two
foreign keys in declaration order and stops at the first violation, so a request
naming two unknown wallets is blamed on `fromWalletId` alone — verified against a
live database, which reports `transfers_from_wallet_fk`. The caller fixes that
one, retries, and only then learns the destination is also unknown. Reporting
both at once would need a pre-flight
`SELECT id FROM wallets WHERE id = ANY($1)` before the claim: one extra
non-locking read, with the foreign key still behind it as the backstop. Not done
here, because a request naming two unknown wallets is a caller bug, and two round
trips to discover it is a fair price for keeping the existence check in exactly
one place.

**A replay never reaches the foreign key.** `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` inserts no
row when the key is already held, and foreign keys are validated only on an
actual insert — also verified. So replaying a known key with a nonexistent wallet
id produces no `404`. It takes the ordinary replay path, and because wallet ids
are part of `request_hash`, the mismatch returns **`409`** instead.

That is the better answer: the key is already bound to a real transfer, so "this
key was used with different parameters" describes the problem more precisely than
"that wallet does not exist", and the stored transfer is what the caller is
actually in conflict with. The consequence to be aware of is that `404` and `409`
are not interchangeable probes for the same condition — which one an unknown
wallet produces depends on whether the idempotency key was free.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Duplicate request, same parameters | Original transfer returned; no second transfer, no second ledger pair |
| Duplicate request, different parameters | `409`; the stored transfer is untouched |
| Response lost after commit | Retry replays the committed transfer — the reason the key is claimed in the same transaction that moves the money |
| Process crashes mid-transfer | Transaction rolls back; key unclaimed; no partial ledger; safe to retry |
| Insufficient funds | `FAILED` committed, `422`, no money moved, same answer on every replay |
| Unknown wallet, key free | `404`; nothing written, key left unclaimed. If both wallets are unknown only `fromWalletId` is named |
| Unknown wallet, key already held | `409` — the claim inserts no row, so the foreign key is never validated and the hash mismatch answers first |
| Concurrent debits of one wallet | Serialised by `FOR UPDATE`; the second sees the first's balance |
| Contention exceeds `lock_timeout` | `55P03` → `503`; safe to retry unchanged |
| Overdraft attempted despite the check | `CHECK (balance >= 0)` aborts the transaction → `500`. Unreachable by design; the constraint exists so a logic bug corrupts nothing |
| Balance overflows `BIGINT` | `22003` → `500`. Not defended against further; the bound is ~9.2×10¹⁸ minor units |

A constraint violation aborts the whole transaction in PostgreSQL, which is why
the sufficiency check under the lock is the real path and `CHECK (balance >= 0)`
is only the backstop: the service cannot catch it and write `FAILED` in the same
transaction without a savepoint.

## Retry behaviour

`503` and `500` are retryable with the **same** key — that is what the key is
for. `400`, `404`, and `409` are terminal; retrying changes nothing. `422` is
terminal for that key: the transfer failed and will keep reporting that it
failed. Retrying the *intent* requires a new key.

## Indexes

`wallets` and `transfers` are reached by primary key, and `transfers` also by
`idempotency_key`, which its `UNIQUE` constraint already indexes.
`UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)` on `ledger_entries` doubles as the index for
reading a transfer's entries. The single explicit secondary index is
`(wallet_id, id)` on `ledger_entries`, for per-wallet reads and for the test
asserting stored balance equals the sum of a wallet's entries.

**No index exists for querying transfers by wallet**, because nothing queries
them that way — transfer history is out of scope. Adding one now would be
speculative. A transfer-history endpoint would want
`(from_wallet_id, created_at DESC)`, and a symmetric index on `to_wallet_id`
only if incoming history were exposed too; `to_wallet_id` is deliberately left
unindexed until a reader exists.

## Consistency expectations

- The ledger always balances: every transfer has exactly one `DEBIT` and one
  `CREDIT` of equal amount, enforced by `UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)` and by
  writing both entries in the transfer's own transaction.
- A wallet's stored balance always equals the sum of its ledger entries. Stored
  balance is the operational value; the ledger is the audit record. A test
  asserts they agree.
- No ledger entry can exist without its transfer (foreign key), and no transfer
  can reference a wallet that does not exist (foreign key).
- A transfer is `FAILED` if and only if it carries a `failure_reason`.

## Observability

Structured logging via stdlib `log/slog`, one record per request carrying
transfer id, idempotency key, both wallet ids, amount, outcome state, whether it
was a replay, and duration. That is enough to answer "what happened to this
transfer" and "is this caller retrying" from logs alone. Amounts are logged;
wallet ids are opaque identifiers, not personal data.

Metrics and tracing are out of scope. The counters worth adding first would be
transfers by outcome, replay rate, and lock-timeout rate.

## Testing

Integration tests run against a **real PostgreSQL**. The database is never
mocked: a mocked query passes happily while the SQL underneath it is wrong, and
the SQL is where every guarantee in this document actually lives. Tests skip
when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset, so `go test ./...` works without a database;
CI starts one and sets it.

Wallets are seeded by a test helper inserting rows directly, since no endpoint
creates them. Each test works on its own wallet ids so tests do not interfere.

Behaviour covered:

- happy path: balances move, exactly two ledger entries, transfer `PROCESSED`
- duplicate key: original transfer returned, no second transfer, no second pair
- duplicate key, different parameters: `409`, stored transfer untouched
- insufficient funds: `FAILED` committed, no money moved, replay returns `422`
- unknown wallet: `404`, nothing written, key left unclaimed
- known key naming an unknown wallet: `409` rather than `404`, since the
  claim never reaches the foreign key
- concurrent debits of one wallet: no double spend, no negative balance
- invariant: every wallet's stored balance equals the sum of its ledger entries

Assertions are behavioural — balances, entries, states, status codes — not
assertions about which queries ran.

### Schema verification

The migration's constraints were verified against a live database rather than
assumed: 16 assertions, each attempting a write the schema must reject and
checking the SQLSTATE and constraint name produced. All 16 pass. The migration
is idempotent across repeated runs, and `lock_timeout` was measured firing at
3.02s under real row contention.
