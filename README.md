# Wallet Transfer Service

A wallet-to-wallet transfer API in Go and PostgreSQL, built so that **every
guarantee a constraint can express is expressed as a constraint**. Idempotency is
a `UNIQUE` constraint, not a check-then-insert. An overdraft is a `CHECK`, not an
`if`. A second debit on one transfer is `UNIQUE (transfer_id, type)`, not a
convention.

The one invariant that needs more than a constraint — that a transfer's two
ledger entries are both present and balanced — is held by construction in the
domain instead, and [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) says exactly where the
schema stops.

The full design — API contract, transaction shape, failure modes, and for each
decision the alternative that was rejected — is in
**[`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md)**.

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.24+ and Docker.

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://wallet:wallet@localhost:5432/wallet?sslmode=disable'
go run ./cmd/server
```

The server migrates on boot and listens on `:8080`.

Wallets are assumed to exist — nothing in scope creates one — so seed a couple:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "INSERT INTO wallets (id, balance) VALUES
  ('wallet_1', 1000), ('wallet_2', 0);"
```

Then move some money:

```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/transfers \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"idempotencyKey":"abc123","fromWalletId":"wallet_1","toWalletId":"wallet_2","amount":100}'
```

Send it **twice**. The second call returns `200` with `Idempotent-Replay: true`
and a byte-identical body, and the money moves only once.

## API

### `POST /transfers`

```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId": "wallet_2",
  "amount": 100
}
```

`amount` is an integer in **minor units** (cents) — never a float. `100.5` is
rejected at decode rather than truncated, and an unknown field is rejected
rather than ignored, so a misspelled `"ammount"` fails loudly instead of sending
a transfer of zero.

Every outcome that produced a transfer returns the same body:

```json
{
  "id": "9f8c1a4e-0f1e-4c2b-9a77-6b2d1f0c5a31",
  "idempotencyKey": "abc123",
  "fromWalletId": "wallet_1",
  "toWalletId": "wallet_2",
  "amount": 100,
  "state": "PROCESSED",
  "failureReason": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-09-14T10:23:03Z"
}
```

`state` is the authoritative answer. A client never has to read the status code
to learn what happened to its money — which matters, because the status code is
the part most likely to be rewritten by a proxy.

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `201 Created` | A new transfer was created and processed |
| `200 OK` | Replay of a processed key — identical body, `Idempotent-Replay: true` |
| `400 Bad Request` | Malformed JSON, unknown field, or failed validation |
| `404 Not Found` | A wallet does not exist |
| `409 Conflict` | Key already used with **different** parameters |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Insufficient funds — first call and every replay |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Lock timeout; safe to retry unchanged |

Conditions that produced no transfer return an error object instead:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "WALLET_NOT_FOUND", "message": "wallet wallet_9 does not exist" } }
```

## Design decisions

Five choices worth knowing before reading the code. Each is argued in full, with
its rejected alternative, in [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md).

1. **Stored balance, not derived.** `CHECK (balance >= 0)` makes an overdraft
   impossible to *store*. The ledger remains the audit record, and a test
   asserts the two always agree.
2. **Pessimistic locking.** Both wallet rows are locked before the balance is
   read, so the balance checked is the balance written against. Locks are taken
   in ascending wallet-id order, sorted in Go rather than with `ORDER BY`, so
   the ordering is a property of the code and not of the query plan.
3. **Idempotency by unique constraint.** The key is claimed with
   `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING`, so the database
   arbitrates between concurrent duplicates rather than application code. A
   `request_hash` over the parsed fields catches a key replayed with different
   parameters and answers `409`.
4. **A failed transfer is committed, not rolled back.** Rolling back would
   release the idempotency key, so a retry could re-attempt the debit and
   succeed once the balance changed — one key producing two different answers.
5. **`FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, not `FOR UPDATE`.** The claim's foreign keys take a
   `FOR KEY SHARE` lock on both wallets, which `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with — so
   concurrent transfers on one wallet would deadlock trying to upgrade a lock
   they already share. Lock ordering cannot prevent that.

## Layout

```
cmd/server         HTTP server
cmd/migrate        applies migrations and exits
migrations/        schema, embedded in the binary
internal/handler   HTTP only: parse, map outcomes to status codes
internal/service   business logic, orchestration, transaction boundaries
internal/repository every SQL statement; translates driver errors to domain errors
internal/domain    entities, state transitions, validation rules
internal/dbtest    fixtures shared by the integration tests
docs/design.md     the design note
```

Dependencies are one-directional: `domain` imports nothing, and nothing above
`repository` imports pgx.

## Testing

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
export TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://wallet:wallet@localhost:5432/wallet?sslmode=disable'
go test -race ./...
```

Integration tests run against **real PostgreSQL**. The database is never mocked:
a mocked query passes happily while the SQL underneath it is wrong, and the SQL
is where the locking, the constraints and the idempotency claim actually live.
Every bug found during this build was an interaction between layers, which no
mock would have reproduced.

With `TEST_DATABASE_URL` unset the integration tests skip and the suite passes,
so a fresh clone gives a clear message rather than a dozen connection errors.
With `CI` set they **fail** instead — a skipped test and a passing test are both
green, and a pipeline that quietly stopped exercising the SQL would report
success while testing nothing.

Migrations are applied by the test fixture, so no separate step is needed.

## Configuration

| Variable | Used by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | server, migrate | — (required) | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `ADDR` | server | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | tests | — | Database for integration tests; unset skips them |
| `CI` | tests | — | When set, a missing `TEST_DATABASE_URL` fails instead of skipping |

Connections carry `lock_timeout = 3s`. Pessimistic locking's failure mode is one
stuck transaction blocking every transfer touching that wallet indefinitely; a
bounded wait surfaces as a retryable `503` instead of a hang.
